OBS Browser Source for creating an image based avatar that animates to audio input. Useful for PNG-tubing or as a TTS avatar.
## Usage
1. Open OBS
2. Check your OBS version by reading the window title
    - If it's under 27 (26 or lower), you need to update OBS
    - If it's 27, close OBS and install the [OBS Websocket Plugin](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/releases/tag/5.0.1)
    - If it's over 27 (28 or higher), you can skip this step
2. With OBS open, visit the [PNGTube Setup Page](https://sugoidogo.github.io/pngtube2/v8/) and authorize OBS.
3. After configuring all your settings, hit 'Save & Download' to get your avatar.
You can drag & drop this file into your scene in OBS, or create a browser source, check the 'Local file' option, and select your avatar.
